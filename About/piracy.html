      <h2 id="about-piracy-title">About Piracy (i.e. Pirating)</h2>
      <p><strong>Piracy</strong> — also known as <strong>pirating</strong> — is the act of copying, distributing, or using content without authorization from its creators or copyright holders. This can include downloading, uploading, or sharing <strong>pirated</strong> versions of games, software, or digital media. Piracy violates copyright laws and undermines the work of developers, artists, and contributors who depend on fair compensation.</p>
      <p>At <strong>ToadVille Bay G.P.</strong>, we protect the integrity of our digital products. Our main releases include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ToadVille Bay</strong> – CA$15 or 1000 Robux</li>
        <li><strong>GhostVista Gets Grounded</strong> – CA$4</li>
        <li><strong>The Restaurant</strong> – 25 Robux</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Purchasing these officially supports our team and ensures players receive safe, verified versions with updates and community features. Using <strong>pirated copies</strong> not only breaks the law, but also risks exposing users to malware and broken game experiences.</p>

      <div class="info-cards">
        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>Software Piracy</h3>
          <p>Refers to illegally downloading, copying, or sharing digital versions of our software and games without purchase. This includes sharing <strong>pirated installers</strong>, repackaged files, or cracked executables.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unlicensed downloads or uploads</li>
            <li>Modified game files or cracked versions</li>
            <li>Unauthorized resale of our software</li>
            <li>Sharing developer builds or betas</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>Game Piracy</h3>
          <p>Involves duplicating or distributing our games (like <em>ToadVille Bay</em> and <em>other games</em>) without permission. <strong>Pirated games</strong> often lack key updates and features while putting players’ data at risk.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unofficial Roblox uploads or copies</li>
            <li>Reuploaded or cloned game experiences</li>
            <li>Repackaged versions without developer consent</li>
            <li>Unauthorized game server emulators</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>Media & Asset Piracy</h3>
          <p>Refers to using <strong>pirated assets</strong> such as GhostVista Gets Grounded without credit or permission. This includes fan uploads that bypass fair use or rehost full media files.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reposting official soundtracks or art</li>
            <li>Reusing code or visual assets without consent</li>
            <li>Using brand materials to promote fake versions</li>
            <li>Streaming or publishing full copyrighted scenes</li>

    <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="how-piracy-happens-title">
      <h2 id="how-piracy-happens-title">How Piracy Happens — Common Methods</h2>
      <p>People share or distribute pirated content in lots of ways. Knowing the methods helps players report things faster and helps creators target prevention.</p>

      <div class="info-cards">
        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>BitTorrent & Torrent Sites</h3>
          <p>BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol used to share files between many users. Torrents and magnet links point to distributed copies of files — games, installers, soundtracks — hosted across many machines. While the protocol has legitimate uses, it's commonly used to share pirated copies.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Files are split into pieces and exchanged among peers.</li>
            <li>Public torrent indexes often list pirated releases.</li>
            <li>Private trackers and invite-only communities can also distribute pirated builds.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>Direct-Download & Cyberlocker Sites</h3>
          <p>Some sites host pirated files directly or provide temporary download links (often called cloud lockers). These are one-click downloads that let users grab repackaged installers or zipped game folders.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Links are frequently re-uploaded under new filenames.</li>
            <li>Downloads may include malware or unwanted extras.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) & File-Sharing Networks</h3>
          <p>Apart from BitTorrent, other P2P systems and older file-sharing networks enable users to share files directly. P2P sharing can include entire folders of game assets or development builds.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>Streaming Rips & Rehosts</h3>
          <p>Someone can record or rip streamed content (gameplay, cutscenes, music) and reupload it to video or file-hosting sites. These rehosts sometimes distribute full game assets or installer links in descriptions/comments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>Cracks, Keygens & Warez Packs</h3>
          <p>Cracked executables, key generators, or warez packs modify or bypass licensing checks. These are often bundled with harmful programs and can compromise users’ systems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>Account Sharing & Unauthorized Access</h3>
          <p>Sharing paid accounts, license keys, or handing out access tokens enables unauthorized use or distribution without actual file copies being shared publicly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>Clones, Reuploads & Fake Listings</h3>
          <p>On platforms like Roblox, mobile app stores, or indie game marketplaces, copycats may clone experiences, reupload assets, or create fake product pages that look official but are unauthorised.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>Social Media & Messaging Links</h3>
          <p>Pirated files are often spread via forum posts, social media, instant messages, and private groups — especially through short-lived links or QR codes that point to hosting services.</p>
        </div>

    <!-- NEW: How to spot & avoid pirated files -->
    <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="spot-avoid-title">
      <h2 id="spot-avoid-title">How to Spot & Avoid Pirated Files</h2>
      <p>Keep yourself safe and support creators. Here are practical signs and steps to avoid pirated or dangerous downloads.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Suspicious filenames or archives:</strong> installers with unofficial prefixes, multiple .exe files, or ZIP/RAR files labelled "crack" or "keygen".</li>
        <li><strong>Missing updates or broken features:</strong> pirated copies often lack online features, bug fixes, or DLC support.</li>
        <li><strong>Too-good-to-be-true offers:</strong> free downloads of paid games from untrusted sites are a red flag.</li>
        <li><strong>Unexpected prompts:</strong> installers that require disabling antivirus, running unknown programs, or entering license keys from third parties — do not follow these prompts.</li>
        <li><strong>Check official sources first:</strong> always compare file sizes, release notes, and download pages with our official site or storefront listing before installing anything.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you suspect a download is pirated, don't run it. Save screenshots, the original link, and any filenames — then report it to us at <a href="mailto:support@toadvillebay.com" class="btn-primary">support@toadvillebay.com</a>.</p>

            <li>Report suspicious uploads or experiences — your tip can speed up takedowns.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>For Developers & Teams</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep official download pages and storefront metadata clear and up to date.</li>
            <li>Use watermarking, unique builds, or licence-check mechanisms where appropriate.</li>

          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p><em>Note:</em> No single technical measure eliminates piracy. The most effective approach mixes good platform practices, community reporting, and targeted enforcement.</p>
