      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>Starting <strong>January 1, 2026</strong>, the <strong>Steam version of ToadVille Bay</strong> will officially end support for <strong>Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8</strong>. Players using these operating systems will no longer be able to access or launch the game through Steam after this date.</p>
      <p>Previously, Steam itself dropped support for Windows Vista, 7, and 8 (excluding Windows 8.1 and 10), and this move aligns ToadVille Bay’s Steam version with those legacy decisions to ensure stability, security, and compatibility. We will not be dropping support for Windows 10 until 2029 as it just recently ended support and still has a high market share</p>

      <h2 id="futureplans">Future Support Plans</h2>
      <p>Following the end of support for Vista, 7, and 8, ToadVille Bay G.P. plans the following phase-outs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Windows 8.1:</strong> Support is expected to end <strong>around July 2026</strong>. Players are encouraged to upgrade before that date to avoid service disruption.</li>
        <li><strong>Windows 10:</strong> Support is planned to end <strong>in 2029</strong>, reflecting Microsoft’s end-of-support for Windows 10. This ensures alignment with the official OS lifecycle while giving players a long transition period.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These timelines are designed to ensure a smooth transition for players while maintaining focus on modern, secure platforms such as Windows 11 and future operating systems.</p>
